So the goal for this lab is to properly configure 1 physical router and 1 physical switch. Two VLANs are created and segmented using the switches, and then they are connected together using the router.

* Create 2 VLANs
* Trunk link between switch and router
* Subinterface-based routing
* Static IPs for each VLAN
* Foundation for NAT/DHCP for future labs
